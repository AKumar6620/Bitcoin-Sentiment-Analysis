ThinkingUSD,1514901525906272266,2022-04-15 09:40:43+00:00,"@ThinkingUSD The point is this:

The traders and market makers pushing the price into alignment with the Nasdaq, are wrong.

They think they have it figured out as a risk asset, but they're just guiding Bitcoin towards the biggest supply shock in its entire history."
ThinkingUSD,1514871267706482699,2022-04-15 07:40:29+00:00,"@ThinkingUSD I get a roughly 188% return for BTC from Jan 2018-present (buying right at an intermediate top), 307% for ETH since then.

116% for NDX over the same time period, so perhaps why trade the Nasdaq is the more relevant question?"

ThinkingUSD,1514808698253680641,2022-04-15 03:31:52+00:00,@ThinkingUSD I have asked myself the same question every single time I‚Äôve watched people trade crypto on ‚Äútechnicals‚Äù ugghhh it‚Äôs going to do what the stock market does x5.  Still reactionary at this phase.  Think it‚Äôs a tail wags dog scenario though.  Trad fi is tail and btc is dog.
ThinkingUSD,1514755748219297792,2022-04-15 00:01:27+00:00,"@ThinkingUSD We‚Äôre not, nas100 is not following Bitcoin pattern or vice versa"
ThinkingUSD,1514695656375562242,2022-04-14 20:02:40+00:00,"@ThinkingUSD ... just understanding that the entire life of btc (from 2010 till today) was in a stock market bullrun, btc never experienced a stock market crash. Btc will almost die, hope it does not."

ThinkingUSD,1514649879125049351,2022-04-14 17:00:46+00:00,"@ThinkingUSD Everybody wanted institutions and mainstream adoption to come in and pump their bags. Correlation with traditional markets was the cost.

""If you can't handle me at my 0.91 correlation to Nasdaq, you don't deserve me at $69k"" - BTC"
ThinkingUSD,1514620277992435718,2022-04-14 15:03:09+00:00,"@ThinkingUSD Don't you get it?  They won.  The banks won the war.
Everyone cried for mass adoption.  We got it.
Everyone cried for BTC in their 401k's.  We got it (kind of).

This is the price we pay now.  We've lost our baby to the system."
